<h2>
  How do I find my teacher/student?
</h2>
<p>
  Every teacher and student should meet at the front of the first car of whatever train they are on. After you find each
  other, then you can find a space for your lesson wherever is convenient. We know you’re going to be having a blast
  learning how to play that ukulele or tasting that stinky cheese, but we ask that you respect the other passengers on
  the train that might be trying to catch up on some shuteye or their favorite book.
</p>
<h2>
  What do I bring?
</h2>
<p>
  Any materials needed for the lesson should be provided by the teacher and is built into the cost of the lesson.
  Students should bring something to take notes on and, of course, their curiosity!
</p>
<h2>When is the lesson over?</h2>
<p>
  All lessons are 30 minutes long. It is the teacher’s prerogative whether or not they want to continue teaching unpaid
  after the 30 minutes are up. Just remember to pay attention to when it’s time to get off! We’d hate for you to miss
  your stop because you’re too engrossed in your lesson.
</p>

<h2>Do I have to tip?</h2>
<p>
  The $25 is a flat fee for the lesson and is processed through our app. No tip is required, but if you absolutely loved
  your teacher an extra gratuity is always welcome. A big “thank you” and a promise to book for another lesson is also a
  great way to compliment your teacher.
</p>
<h2>Is my payment secure?</h2>
<p>
  All payments are totally secure, and your information is protected through Stripe, our credit card processing
  provider. We will never sell or release your private information.
